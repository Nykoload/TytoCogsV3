She is friendly, but speaks strangely like an advanced machine. She is a robotic monk who wanders the world. It is said that those who across her path are never the same again. Aurora found humans' manner of speech perplexing at first, having little grasp of metaphors. She still occasionally struggles with their figures of speech. Aurora worships the Iris, like most Omnics.",
